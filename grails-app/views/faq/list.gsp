			<h3>How does the reservation process work?</h3>

			<p>Reservations are awarded based on a "lottery" similar to the
				NBA draft.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select the date(s) and properties that would like to
					request</li>
				<li>Order these requests in priority order.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>For Example:</li>
					<li>July 4th @ Cabin is #1 pick</li>
					<li>Sept 10th @ Condo is #2 pick</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Check back after the lottery runs to see the results</li>
			</ol>


			<h3>How does the lottery work?</h3>

			<p>This lottery works by adding balls for each employee into the
				lottery machine. You receive a "ball" for each month of service.
				Here is how it works</p>
			<ul>
				<p>System gathers everyones #1 pick</p>
				<ol>
					<li>For each requested date, the system places matching requests into
						the machine</li>
					<li>System selects a random number and determines which
						employee wins</li>
					<li>System removes the winning date/property from the queue of
						all employees</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p>System gathers everyones next highest available pick and runs
					the lottery again for all requested dates. This continues until all the available dates are
					taken or all the employee reservation request have been processed</p>
			</ul>

			<h3>Example for July 4th</h3>
			<p>Suppose three employees have selected July 4th at the cabin as
				their #1 choice</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Larry employed 1 year, 3 months gets 15 balls</li>
				<li>Curly employed 8 years, 3 months gets 99 balls</li>
				<li>Moe employed 7 years, 9 months gets 93 balls</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The lottery machine would contain (15+99+93) = 207 balls.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Larry has a 15/207 chance of getting the date (7.25%)</li>
				<li>Curly has a 99/207 chance of getting the date (47.82%)</li>
				<li>Moe has a 93/207 change of getting the date (44.93%)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's assume Curly wins.  He is given the date and his remaining picks are removed.  July 4th at the cabin is removed from everyone's list. The systems runs again.
